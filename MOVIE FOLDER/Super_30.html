Anand dreams of providing underprivileged students with the opportunity to pursue higher education and compete for a spot at the prestigious Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs).

        <b>Inspiring and Motivational Movie</b>
        <p>An Inspirational movie, Hrithik did a great job. He gave his 100% hardwork in this movie. Movie is based on Anand Sir life who runs Super30. As I was the part of Super30 2015 batch, I know the complete story more than what shown in movie. Anand sir life has been depicted so well in this movie. A different class performance by Hrithik, Hope movie will inspire lots of youth from India and overseas.</p>

        <b>Super 30 brings ignites a storm of emotions while sending out a very important message.</b>
        <p>The movie is gripping and absolutely scintillating. Not the typical Bollywood masala film though. The film makes you cry, laugh, feel delighted and helpless at the state of affairs in our society. The direction is great and except for 15-20 minutes in the second half, where the film is a bit slow, there is never a dull moment.

            Casting is fantastic as it is and Hrithik Roshan has once again proven that he is arguably the best actor among all the superstars of Bollywood. Pankaj Tripathi has again delivered a great performance in his limited role.
            
            All in all a must watch movie. After all it is rare to see a superstar delivering a content driven film.</p>
