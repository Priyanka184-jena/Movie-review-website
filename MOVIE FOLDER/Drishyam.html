        <b>Expect the Unexpected (10/10)</b>
        <p>I have always regretted not been able to watch Drishyam (2015) in theaters. But the day Drishyam 2 announced I decided to watch it in theaters for sure.

            I have literally no words to praise this masterpiece. This movie is gonna create history at box office for sure.
            
            Ajay Devgn and Akshay Khanna did fabulous work. When I watched Drishyam in 2015 I told one of my friends that it's my favorite Ajay Devgn movie but now it's Not. Now Drishyam 2.
            
            I don't want to spoil anything for you all, just go to cinema hall and watch this movie or you will regret it for sure.
            
            It is one of the best suspense thriller from bollywood.
            
            HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.</p>

        <b>Great performances, superb movie üëèüèΩ</b>
        <p>It's a great movie. After a very long time I've been for a bollywood movie and i was very happy with Drishyam 2.

            Note: I had watched Malayalam Drishyam 2 on OTT, so i knew the story. But at no point i felt bored. The performances were unique and dialogue deliveries were excellent. Ajay Devgan and Tabu did great and everyone else enabled them to excel in it.
            
            The cinematography was amazing keeping you hooked onto your seats.
            
            The best part was the casting was the same as part 1. We could see how everyone has actually changed with time and could relate.
            
            The movie is skillfully made such that even if someone has not watched part 1, can enjoy this movie.
            
            Definitely a great movie to enjoy with family.</p>

        <b>The story writing just blows your mind!</b>
        <p>Usually when sequels fail in Indian cinema, drishyam 2 has held its ground very firmly and the writers have done a phenomenal job! The story, the build-up is superb. It's a must must watch. Loved it!

            The movie doesn't loose it's pace even once. The story before or after the intermission just kept us at the edge of our seats! I didn't even left my seat for a 2nd round of popcorn! Imagine! I wish to see this movie again.
            
            The cast is as usual amazing and the director has kept the time of the movie very much on point. No glamour. Just the story. That's what we expect the cinema to be. Great job to every contributing member of the crew and cast.</p>
