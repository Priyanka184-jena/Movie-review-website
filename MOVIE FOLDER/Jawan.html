        <b>Full on entertainment</b>
        <p>The movie was entertaining with blend of a lot of drama, little
           comedy, some thrill, some suspense and a lot of action. The story was good with a good message in it, the screenplay was uneven but doesn't damages the story, the direction was good and the performances were also good. The BGM and the action scenes were great, you will love them. Also, the message the movie wanted to show was good and effective.
           Some scenes were rushed and some things remained unexplained but the story is shown in such a grand way that these things will not bother you that much.
           Overall, you should definitely give this movie a try.</p>
